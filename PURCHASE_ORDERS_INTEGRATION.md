# Purchase Orders Integration with Bulk Order System

## Overview
Successfully integrated the Purchase Orders page (`http://localhost:8080/inventory/purchase-orders`) with the bulk order system backend, replacing mock data with real API calls.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes (PurchaseOrders.tsx)

1. **API Integration**
   - Replaced mock data with real API calls to `/inventory/bulk-orders/`
   - Added loading states and error handling
   - Integrated with existing AutocompleteInput components

2. **Supplier Management**
   - Added `external_only=true` parameter to filter suppliers from other organizations
   - Prevents internal purchase orders (users can only order from external suppliers)
   - Enhanced supplier search with organization information

3. **Product Search**
   - Disabled product search until supplier is selected
   - Products are filtered by selected supplier's organization inventory
   - Real-time search with autocomplete functionality

4. **Order Creation**
   - Integrated with bulk order creation API
   - Proper validation for supplier selection and product items
   - Form reset after successful order creation
   - Real-time order list refresh

5. **Status Mapping**
   - Mapped bulk order statuses to display statuses:
     - `draft`, `submitted`, `supplier_reviewing` → `pending`
     - `supplier_confirmed`, `buyer_reviewing`, `buyer_confirmed` → `confirmed`
     - `shipped` → `shipped`
     - `delivered`, `completed`, `released`, `imported` → `delivered`
     - `cancelled` → `cancelled`

### Backend Changes

1. **User API Enhancement (accounts/views.py)**
   - Added `external_only` parameter to filter supplier users from other organizations
   - Added search functionality for users (name, email, phone)
   - Enhanced supplier filtering logic

2. **User Model Properties (accounts/models.py)**
   - Added `organization_name` property to get organization name
   - Added `branch_name` property to get branch name
   - These properties are used by the serializer for API responses

## API Endpoints Used

### 1. Bulk Orders
- **GET** `/inventory/bulk-orders/` - List all bulk orders
- **POST** `/inventory/bulk-orders/` - Create new bulk order

### 2. Suppliers
- **GET** `/auth/users/?role=supplier_admin&external_only=true` - Get external suppliers
- **GET** `/auth/users/?role=supplier_admin&search={query}&external_only=true` - Search suppliers

### 3. Products
- **GET** `/inventory/products/purchase-order/?q={query}&supplier_id={id}` - Search products by supplier

## Data Flow

1. **Page Load**
   - Fetch existing bulk orders
   - Load external suppliers for dropdown

2. **Create Order**
   - User selects supplier from external organizations only
   - User searches and selects products from supplier's inventory
   - User sets expected delivery date and notes
   - System creates bulk order with status `SUBMITTED`
   - Order appears in the list immediately

3. **Order Display**
   - Orders show with mapped status badges
   - Order details include items, quantities, and pricing (when available)
   - Real-time status updates

## Key Features

### Security
- Users can only create orders with suppliers from external organizations
- Product search is restricted to selected supplier's inventory
- Proper authentication and authorization checks

### User Experience
- Autocomplete inputs for better search experience
- Disabled product search until supplier is selected
- Loading states and error messages
- Form validation and feedback

### Data Integrity
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Status tracking and audit logs
- Transaction-safe order creation

## Testing

Run the test script to verify endpoints:
```bash
python test_integration.py
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start Backend Server**
   ```bash
   cd pharmacy_backend
   python manage.py runserver 8080
   ```

2. **Start Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd pharma
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access Purchase Orders**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/inventory/purchase-orders`
   - Click "Create Purchase Order"
   - Select an external supplier
   - Add products from supplier's inventory
   - Set delivery date and notes
   - Submit order

## Status Workflow

The bulk order follows this workflow:
1. **DRAFT** → **SUBMITTED** (Order created by buyer)
2. **SUBMITTED** → **SUPPLIER_CONFIRMED** (Supplier confirms with pricing)
3. **SUPPLIER_CONFIRMED** → **BUYER_CONFIRMED** (Buyer accepts pricing)
4. **BUYER_CONFIRMED** → **SHIPPED** (Supplier ships order)
5. **SHIPPED** → **DELIVERED** (Order delivered)
6. **DELIVERED** → **COMPLETED** (Order completed)
7. **COMPLETED** → **RELEASED** (Supplier releases stock)
8. **RELEASED** → **IMPORTED** (Buyer imports stock)

## Next Steps

1. **Supplier Dashboard**: Create supplier interface to manage incoming orders
2. **Order Tracking**: Add tracking functionality for shipped orders
3. **Payment Integration**: Add payment processing for orders
4. **Inventory Sync**: Automatic inventory updates when orders are completed
5. **Notifications**: Email/SMS notifications for order status changes
